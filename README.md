## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on techniques resizing for non-standard images, changing of the source of an image element, and making sure these changes worked for the mobile version. I also focused on adding alternative scroll elements to this website, although scrolling to next section element did not work very well on the mobile version.

## Optimizations

I created a container for the images to be resized automatically so the images fit its aspect ratio and changes based on the screen size. I used a container instead of the image size being set manually. Prior to this change without the cover value, the images were not covering its container leaving some empty spaces.

## Lessons Learned:

The key takeaways for me during this project was using online resources to learn new techniques and to gain insights into best practices for responsive web design, optimizing images, and creating a seamless user experience across different devices.
